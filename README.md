==========================

What I got done during the specified hackathon.

On the 6th of June, the year of 2013, a hackathon was held around the theme of using organizing and political data apis.

The idea was simple, since I arrived with just a few hours to execute.

Idea: Quickly assess what ideas a policy maker concerns themselves with using data visualization

Why: The sunlight api makes it easy to find a legislators ngram count so that we can see the words they use the most

This uses meteor and was an attempt for me, not to place or win a hackathon, but to see how quickly I could learn 
what I needed to in meteor to accomplish the task.

The result here is very imperfect.  Sometimes the data is fetched, sometimes not.  When it isn't, we get a forEach
error on the client.

As a part of this I was also trying to learn how to do this with the D3 library.  I brought on the package and linked out
to raw github js files from a d3 repo, but it was all too hacky and couldn't hold up in demo time.

So here are the results.  It does demonstrate a the Meteor.http.call.
